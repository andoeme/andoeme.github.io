# Teaping service 

## Problem 

Amrita is a woman living close to the Darjeeling hills. She is working in a tea plantation earning almost 2 $ a day for this back breaking job. She lives in a slum under unhygienic conditions and has no healthcare or education. We pay a lot of money for the amazing tea that we drink even if the actual person picking it gets almost nothing.

## Solution

Teaping provides transactions of micro payments from tea enthusiasts to local tea farmers. You can show your appreciation for the hard work they put into your product. Just sign up into the platform and send an amount into a blockchain wallet and our service shares this money fairly and evenly between them. With the help of the blockchain technology and the support of the local cooperative we can connect two sides of this line.
